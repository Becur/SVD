# SVD

This project is part of my Bachelor's degree from RTU MIREA. Here is an attempt to write a standard matrix class for calculations and on its basis a singular value decomposition is implemented. I will be glad to receive criticism, including for test cases.

In the future, it is planned to add a parallel version of the calculation operators and a compatible class of sparse matrices, which will increase the speed and accuracy of calculations.

Thank you for your time.
